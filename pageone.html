  Abandoned, you cry, words daring not to escape your fragile frame,
  <br>
  stuck, caught, climbing up your throat in an attempt to choke them
  <br>
  deep inside of you, you'll ruin yourself within the love you crave.
  <br>
  The air grows colder and the night grows dimmer, fading to darkness,
  <br>
  the color of the mourning that paints your pale skin, you've fallen
  <br>
  ill with grief, as you so deny the sickness that takes ahold of you,
  <br>
  mind, body, and soul. I feel the inexplicable urge to hold you close
  <br>
  and whisper that you'll live, but your eyes are bloodshot and you are
  <br>
  too weak to stand, your legs buckle and you hit the floor, imploring
  <br>
  for release by whatever god takes up residence in those haunted halls
  <br>
  up above, yet he is too cruel to answer your pleas, as your lips waver
  <br>
  wordlessly and I can see the mortality in your eyes. Again, again,
  <br>
  you relive memories too painful to imagine and torture yourself
  <br>
  endlessly, punishing yourself for faults that are not your own. Your
  <br>
  body begs for release but your mind is a merciless master, you scream
  <br>
  in anguish when you realize your nightmares have become reality and
  <br>
  your fears have become truth. You whisper to me, once, a single word,
  <br>
  your voice carrying over the cavern that separates us.
